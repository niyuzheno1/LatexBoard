# LatexBoard

P.S. I did all the work.

## Inspiration

I am inspired by Youtubers Blackpenredpen and SecondThread to write this app so that professor and student can study subjects like math in a judicious and wise manner. I was also inspired by my personal experience of studying Machine Learning at UC Riverside to create this app.

## What it does

It provides professionals in Math or Computer Science and other STEM field studies unique experience so they will be able to write in latex freely. 

## How I built it

I used react.js to build this app as a web-based app due to my knowledge of using observableHQ for the slides being full screen. 

## Challenges I ran into

There are a lot of challenges that I have ran into. I was designing the upload button. However, I couldn't figure out a way to build an upload button in an effective way. Whenever I tried to access the content from SVG file, I could not write to the state again. I finally did some work around and fix the issue. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I have finished this app in 24 hours without using extra APIs such as Flask or Google. And all the work is solely written by Zach (Yuzhe) Ni.

## What I learned

I have learned that it's hard to build an app solely based on one library. And I anticipated that I can learn more by reading other people's experience or maybe by doing my own research or doing my own experience. I can finish all the challenges I am facing in an effective way. 


## What's next for Latex Board: A Tale of Zoom Classroom

I will add more functionalities to the app. We can draw polygons such as pentagon, rectangle in the app. On top of that, we can also add more functionalities such as when a person speaks, the computer automatically translate the voice into latex. However, for this, we need a little bit of skills in Natural Language Processing.
